This is a simple application that gets weather data from the open weather API and displays it in a list based on where the user is located. You need to grant the location permissions.

# Running the App

 Before running, make sure you get your api key from the api and add substitute it in the `useGetWeather.tsx` file. On MacOs, run the app using the following command:

```bash
# iOS
npx react-native run-ios

# Android
npx react-native run-android
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
